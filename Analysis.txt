1. Explain the purpose of EC2PrimeDeployRole and why it needs S3 permissions.
   - The EC2PrimeDeployRole allows the EC2 instance to access and download deployment artifacts stored in an S3 bucket. 
     This is necessary because AWS CodeDeploy retrieves the application files from S3 before deploying them to the EC2 instance.

2. How does appspec.yml ensure the application runs after deployment?
   - The appspec.yml file defines the deployment instructions, including where to place the application files and what script to 
     execute after deployment. The "ApplicationStart" hook specifies the "scripts/start.sh" script, which makes "prime.py" 
     executable and runs it, ensuring the program executes correctly after deployment.

3. If the EC2 instance were in a private subnet, what changes would be needed for CodeDeploy to work?
   - If the EC2 instance were in a private subnet, it would not have direct internet access. To enable CodeDeploy to fetch 
     deployment files, we would need to:
     - Set up a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet and route traffic from the private subnet through it.
     - Ensure the private subnet's route table directs internet-bound traffic through the NAT Gateway.
     - Modify the EC2 instance's security group to allow outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic to access AWS services.
